# 🗺️ Civic Tech ZA Roadmap

## Overview

As mentioned before, this is an exploratory, community-driven project. This means that this is not a set-in-stone feature roadmap. We are open to all PRs that might improve this resource! Broken link or spelling/typos fixes are more than welcome too! 😊

Regardless, there are a couple of backlog features we would like to explore:

## Possible Features

| 💡 Include some type of project/contributor directory.
| ---

We would like to add a space for members to showcase active project and highlight willing contributors. Our hope is that this will serve as a platform to link projects that need contributions of time/specific skills to contributors willing to offer these.

This is in line with two of our project goals:

>Link those willing to contribute to civic-tech projects to real-world projects that need their specific skills.

>Provide opportunities and resources for those interested in developing their specific craft or awareness around social/civic issues in South Africa against the backdrop civic technology.


| 💡 Add list of contributors
| ---

We would like to add a page that showcases everyone who has contributed to this project over it's lifetime. This might look something like [_Babel's_](https://github.com/babel/babel#team) or similar contributors sections.

| 💡 Add a list of useful South African civic-tech related resources.
| ---

We would like to create an open-source resource directory that contains videos, newsletters, articles, books, organisations or even content by community members. The aim is that these resources might help individuals or organisations who are interested in starting a civic-tech project or getting involved in an existsing project.

This is in line with our third project goal:

>Provide opportunities and resources for those interested in developing their specific craft or awareness around social/civic issues in South Africa against the backdrop civic technology.

| 💡 Add a curated lists.
| ---

We would like to create curated resources and project lists specific to certain skillsets. For example we might have a curated lists that contain resources and projects specific to front-end developers, back-end developers, designers, journalists or researchers.

This is in line with two of our project goals:

>Link those willing to contribute to civic-tech projects to real-world projects that need their specific skills.

>Provide opportunities and resources for those interested in developing their specific craft or awareness around social/civic issues in South Africa against the backdrop civic technology.

| 💡 Explore whether there is a need to integrate a code of conduct
| ---

As recommended by several members, we might be look into integrating some form of open-source code of conduct. For example the [TODO open code of conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/).


| 💡 Add text interviews/record podcasts episodes to our resources directory
| ---

If there is a need, it might be viable to conduct community-driven interviews with individuals, projects or organisations working within the civic-tech space.
